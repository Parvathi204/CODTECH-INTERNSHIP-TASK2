Overview of the Project:

Project: LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Objective: Explore unsupervised learning techniques by performing clustering analysis on a dataset without predefined labels. Implement clustering algorithms such as K-means, hierarchical clustering, or DBSCAN to identify natural groupings or patterns within the data. Evaluate the clustering results using metrics like silhouette score or Daviesâ€“Bouldin index, and visualize

Key steps:

1.Library Management System
Features:
      *Tracks books and members in a library.
      *Implements borrowing and returning functionality.
Workflow:
      *Members can borrow available books, and the system updates their status.
      *Returned books are marked as available for other users.

2. Clustering Analysis of Books
Dataset:
     Features include page count, popularity, and borrow frequency.
Methodology:
     Data is standardized and clustered into groups using K-Means with 3 clusters.
Evaluation:
     The clustering performance is assessed using the Silhouette Score, ensuring meaningful group formation.
Visualization:
      A scatter plot with cluster centers visualizes the grouping of books based on standardized features.

Uniqueness:
     *Seamlessly integrates library management with clustering for data-driven insights.
     *Provides a dual perspective: operational efficiency and analytical exploration.

Outcomes:
       The Library Management System streamlines book tracking and member borrowing/returning processes. Clustering analysis groups books by features, offering insights into patterns like popularity and borrowing trends.
